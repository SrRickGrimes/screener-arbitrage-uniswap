## **Screener DeFi for Arbitrage with Uniswap Router V2.**

This repository features an implementation of how I've developed a screener for scanning multiple exchanges that implement the Uniswap Router V2. This implementation utilizes advanced techniques such as the Actor Model with the Microsoft Orleans framework. Furthermore, the backend adheres to Clean Architecture principles, enabling the injection of more exchanges that implement Uniswap's Router V2. 

While this backend serves primarily as a screener, it can easily be adapted for executing flash loans. 

There are numerous examples of how to use flash loans, but I have not encountered examples on developing a screener for monitoring purposes, which is why I created it.

Stack used:

 - Microsoft Orleans
 -  NET 8 
 - SQL Server  
 - ASP.NET Core
 -  Nethereum
 - Blazor Server
 - Hardhat
 - Solidity

Notes: I added a basic example how to create a flash loan using solidity but it is not implemented in the backend.
